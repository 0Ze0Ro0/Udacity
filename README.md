### Landing Page
I added a button to add a new section and link it to the navigation bar and add it to it to facilitate navigation on the page 
and added a button to remove sections and link it to the navigation bar and it stops at the fourth section 
and I added a button to return to the top of the page and make the page dynamic in addition to navigation 
and modifying some elements to respond to all screens
